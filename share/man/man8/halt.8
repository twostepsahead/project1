.TH HALT 8 "Jul 26, 2013"
.SH NAME
halt, poweroff \- stop the processor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/halt\fR [\fB-dlnqy\fR]
.fi

.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/sbin/poweroff\fR [\fB-dlnqy\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fBhalt\fR and \fBpoweroff\fR utilities write any pending information to
the disks and then stop the processor. The \fBpoweroff\fR utility has the
machine remove power, if possible.
.sp
.LP
The \fBhalt\fR and \fBpoweroff\fR utilities normally log the system shutdown to
the system log daemon, \fBsyslogd\fR(8), and place a shutdown record in the
login accounting file \fB/var/log/wtmpx\fR. These actions are inhibited if the
\fB-n\fR or \fB-q\fR options are present.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
The \fBhalt\fR and \fBpoweroff\fR utilities do not cleanly shutdown
\fBsmf\fR(5) services. Execute the scripts in \fB/etc/rcnum.d\fR or execute
shutdown actions in \fBinittab\fR(4). To ensure a complete shutdown of system
services, use \fBshutdown\fR(8) or \fBinit\fR(8) to reboot a Solaris system.
