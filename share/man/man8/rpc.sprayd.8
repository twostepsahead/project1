.SH NAME
rpc.sprayd, sprayd \- spray server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/lib/netsvc/spray/rpc.sprayd\fR
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBrpc.sprayd\fR is a server that records the packets sent by \fBspray\fR(8).
The \fBrpc.sprayd\fR daemon may be started by \fBinetd\fR(8) or
\fBlisten\fR(8).
.sp
.LP
The service provided by \fBrpc.sprayd\fR is not useful as a networking
benchmark as it uses unreliable connectionless transports, (udp for example).
It can report a large number of packets dropped when the drops were caused by
the program sending packets faster than they can be buffered locally (before
the packets get to the network medium).
