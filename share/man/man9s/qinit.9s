.Sh NAME
.Nm qinit
.Nd STREAMS queue processing procedures structure
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/stream.h
.Sh INTERFACE LEVEL
.Sy Architecture independent level 1 (DDI/DKI)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
structure contains pointers to processing procedures for a
.Sy QUEUE .
The
.Sy streamtab
structure for the module or driver contains
pointers to one
.Xr queue 9S
structure for both upstream and downstream processing.
.Sh STRUCTURE MEMBERS
The
.Nm
structure includes the following members:
.Bd -literal -offset indent

typedef int (*qi_putp_t)(queue_t *, mblk_t *);
typedef int (*qi_srvp_t)(queue_t *);
typedef int (*qi_qopen_t)(queue_t *, dev_t *, int, int, cred_t *);
typedef int (*qi_qclose_t)(queue_t *, int, cred_t *);
typedef int (*qi_qadmin_t)(void);
typedef int (*qi_rwp_t)(queue_t *, struiod_t *);
typedef int (*qi_infop_t)(queue_t *, infod_t *);
