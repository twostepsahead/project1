Features
========

This file documents feature changes at a very high level.

A '-' means that the support for that feature was removed, a '+' means that
the support for that feature was added, and a '*' means that the behavior
was changed.

1.4 release
-----------
 + native compiler support:
   * all provided compilers and binutils generate 64-bit output by default.
     -m32 is required for 32-bit.
   * gcc 4.9 has been removed. gcc 6.4.0 is now the default compiler
     /usr/bin/cc, and it is used to build userland and the bmake part of base.
   * gcc 4.4.4 aka. illumos-gcc is provided in /opt/gcc/4.4.4/bin/gcc, and it
     is used to build itself as well as the dmake part of base.
   * the default compiler uses GNU binutils ld.bfd as the linker. gcc 4.4.4
     stays with sunld for compatibility.
   * the default compiler does not support Solaris-specific features (eg.
     #pragma init/fini, cmn_err format checking, startfile selection from
     values-{Xa,Xc,Xs,Xt,xpg4,xpg6} based on -std)
   * the default compiler does not define sun/__sun/__sun___ or
     __svr4__/__SVR4. gcc 4.4.4 still does, for compatibility reasons.
   * __unleashed__ is automatically defined by all provided compilers.
 - multiarch support from python removed; it's now 64-bit only
 - /etc/log symlink & /var/adm/log directory
 - /etc/[uw]tmpx symlink
 - /usr/adm symlink
 - legacy accounting and reporting
 * 32-bit libraries moved to i386 subdir of /lib and /usr/lib, and 64-bit
   libraries moved from the amd64 subdir to the top level of /lib and /usr/lib.
   in subdirectories not directly handled by the default ld.so configuration,
   the old style of amd64 subdir is still (mostly) used.
 * moved all /var/adm files to /var/log
 * moved /var/svc/log to /var/log/svc
 * ntp has been replaced with openntpd 6.2p3
 * bash 5.0.3
 * zsh 5.7.1

1.3 release
-----------
 - ksh93 (/sbin/sh, /bin/ksh93, /bin/rksh93) and related libraries (libast,
   libcmd, libdll, libpp, libshell, libsum) are no more.
 - nonstandard getgrent_r, fgetgrent_r removed from libc
 - wordexp & wordfree removed from libc
 - sgtty.h removed, including stty() and gtty()
 - nightly.sh is no more; see README.md for updated build instructions
 * removed posix.1c draft versions, and made default the standard versions, of
   the libc functions getgrgid_r, getgrnam_r, ttyname_r, getlogin_r
 * removed non-posix versions of the libc functions shmdt, sigwait,
   gethostname, putmsg, putpmsg, getaddrinfo
 + _XOPEN_SOURCE=700 and __EXTENSIONS__ are defined by default, if not
   specified. most third-party software already uses these on Solarises in an
   attempt to get a somewhat sane compilation environment
 + all applications automatically use 64-bit files. using the LFS/"large file"
   interfaces _LARGEFILE_SOURCE, _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE and _FILE_OFFSET_BITS is
   no longer necessary.
 + various improvements have been made to shorten the build time.
 + the installer user interface has been simplified considerably.

1.2 release
-----------
 - libfruraw, libnvfru, libfru, libfrureg, libfruutils
 - libpicl, libpicltree, picld(8), etc.
 - pyzfs & pysolaris
 - locator(8)

 + ship ctfconvert & ctfmerge in /usr/bin
 * hwdata updated to 2018.11.29
 * tzdata updated to 2018g
 * libressl 2.8.2
 * uname(1) returns "amd64" for -m and -p
 * sysinfo(SI_ARCHITECTURE) returns "amd64" (or "i386" when UNAME_LEGACY is
   in the environment)
 * rename vnode interface's AT_* to VATTR_*

 - jsh & jsh93
 + ship libcmdutils.so & libuutil.so compilation symlinks
 * ship openbsd ksh as /bin/sh (/bin/ksh93, /bin/rksh93, and /sbin/sh remain
   ksh93)
 * convert BREAD/BWRITE/BWRITE2/GETBLK macros to bread/bwrite/bwrite2/getblk
   static inlines
 * collapse driver packages into system/kernel
 * replace ksh93 /usr/bin builtins with real programs imported from OpenBSD:
   comm, cut, join, kill, logname, paste, rev, sleep, tee, test, uniq, wc
 * autofs is disabled by default
 * zoneinfo data moved from /usr/share/lib/zoneinfo to /usr/share/zoneinfo
