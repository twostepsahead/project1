The ACPI code is currently based on 'joyent/20180629', which is based on
the '20180629' release.

The ACPI utilities are based on the Intel ACPI source code drops.  Most
of the ACPI source code lives in the following directories:

   usr/src/uts/common/acpica		Common to kernel and commands
   usr/src/uts/intel/io/acpica		Kernel
   usr/src/uts/intel/sys/acpi		Headers
   usr/src/cmd/acpi			Commands

We maintain an ACPI repository that has the tools to sync up the ACPI
data in illumos. The repository README has more information on the
repository. It has the following information:

1. Branches with all of our modification on top of our data.

2. Instructions and tools with all of our updates.

3. The tool 'tools/acpica-update' in the repository can be used to
update the ACPI source code in illumos.
