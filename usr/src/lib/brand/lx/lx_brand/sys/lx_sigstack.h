/*
 * Two flavors of Linux signal stacks:
 *
 * lx_sigstack - used for "modern" signal handlers, in practice those
 *               that have the sigaction(2) flag SA_SIGINFO set
 *
 * lx_oldsigstack - used for legacy signal handlers, those that do not have
 *		    the sigaction(2) flag SA_SIGINFO set or that were setup via
 *		    the signal(2) call.
 *
 * NOTE: Since these structures will be placed on the stack and stack math will
 *	 be done with their sizes, for the 32-bit code they must be word
 *	 aligned in size (4 bytes) so the stack remains word aligned per the
 *	 i386 ABI, or, for 64-bit code they must be 16 byte aligned as per the
 *	 AMD64 ABI.
 *
 *	 The precise layout of these stack frames is also potentially
 *	 depended on by particularly esoteric (or broken) software, and
 *	 should be preserved.  The Linux structures (rt_sigframe, et al)
 *	 are defined in "arch/x86/include/asm/sigframe.h".
