# The Open POSIX Test Suite (PTS) tests the POSIX conformance of an
# operating system. A test may have one of six different results:
#
# o PASS: the test passed
# o FAIL: the test failed
# o UNRESOLVED: the test was unable to determine pass/fail
# o UNSUPPORTED: this feature is not supported by the OS
# o UNTESTED: this test is not yet implemented
#
# You can read more about these result codes in:
#
#   ltp/testcases/open_posix_testsuite/Documentation/HOWTO_ResultCodes
#
# This file (pts_ignorelist) contains a list of tests which are known
# not to pass on lx-brand zones, along with the expected test result.
# These tests are grouped based on the reason for their failure,
# described by the comment above the grouping. Ideally, any test
# resulting in FAILED indicates a bug in lx-brand, but PTS is not
# ideal. Many of the tests will return FAILED when they should return
# UNRESOLVED instead. E.g., some of the MQ tests will return FAILED if
# mq_open() fails while some will return UNRESOLVED. Unless otherwise
# noted in the group comment, assume FAILED is a true bug (as opposed
# to a lack of support by lx-brand).
#
# To run the tests and check your results against this list:
#
# cd ltp/testcases/open_posix_testsuite
# make
# make test 2>&1 | tee pts.log
# diff <(egrep -v '^#|^$' /native/usr/lib/brand/lx/pts_ignorelist | sort) \
# <(grep execution pts.log | tr -d : | awk '{ print $1, $3 }' | sort)
#
# Any delta reported by the diff is either a regression in lx-brand or
# a change in the test code.

#
# POSIX message queues are not implemented in lx-brand. In illumos,
# MQs are implemented completely in libc. In Linux, MQs are
# implemented as system calls. The lx-brand code returns ENOSYS for
# all the MQ system calls. The MQ tests are not consistent in how they
# classify a failed mq_open() and thus the tests return a mixture of
# UNRESOLVED and FAILED.
