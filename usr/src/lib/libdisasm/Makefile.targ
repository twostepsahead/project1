# The use of sed is a gross hack needed because the current build system
# assumed that the compiler accepted linker flags (-Bfoo -zfoo and -Mfoo)

# discard the prefixes.  Ideally, we would be using the LD_Z* and LD_B*
# variables instead, but that would require a lot of mucking with makefiles.
# So for now, we do this.
