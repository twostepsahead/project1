#
# To ease the development and maintenance of libfmd_msg, a test suite is built
# directly into the library.  The test program fmd_msg_test.c includes a set of
# tests for all the code paths in the library.  The test program executes the
# calls, and then forks into the background and dumps core.  After the test
# runs, we diff the output against the master hand-verified output, and confirm
# no leaks or corruption exist.  To run the entire suite, type "make test" and
# inspect the results (the make target will fail on an error).
#
# The cmp skips the first 900 bytes of $(SRCDIR)/fmd_msg_test.out to get us
# passed the CDDL header and copyright in that file.
