# Legacy PAM configuration
#
# The shipped PAM configuration has moved from the legacy /etc/pam.conf to
# the new /etc/pam.d model.  See pam.conf(4) for more information.
#
# The following entries are here until userland starts shipping its own
# /etc/pam.d fragments.
#
# GDM Autologin (explicit because of pam_allow).  These need to be
# here as there is no mechanism for packages to amend pam.conf as
# they are installed.
#
gdm-autologin auth  required    pam_unix_cred.so.1
gdm-autologin auth  sufficient  pam_allow.so.1
#
# cups service (explicit because of non-usage of pam_roles.so.1)
#
cups	account	required	pam_unix_account.so.1
#
# GDM Autologin (explicit because of pam_allow) This needs to be here
# as there is no mechanism for packages to amend pam.conf as they are
# installed.
#
gdm-autologin account  sufficient  pam_allow.so.1
