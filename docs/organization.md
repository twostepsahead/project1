Community Organization
======================

Our community is organized similarly to a number of other open source
communities.  There are two groups of people in addition to the users.
They are:

* developers
* committers

Developers
----------

Anyone can be a developer simply by grabbing a copy of the source code and
changing it.  Once a change is made, the developer needs to send the change
to a committer (see below) to get it into the repository.  (Note: ideally
this exchange happens on the mailing list.)

If a developer becomes a frequent contributor, the lead may invite him to
become a committer.

Committers
----------

Committers are frequent contributors that have permissions to commit to the
repository.  They tend to specialize in an area, where most of their
contributions occur.  While committers can commit small changes in their
area without review, they must get larger changes (or changes outside their
area of expertise) reviewed by other members of the community.  (Note:
getting a review is *never* a bad thing.)  Committers are also responsible
for handling contributions submitted by the developers.  That is, giving
review feedback, and eventually committing the change on behalf of the
developer.

A committer that hasn't contributed in a year may lose the commit
privileges due to inactivity.

The current committers are:

* alhazred
* jeffpc
* lotheac
* tsoome

Lead
----

The lead resolves conflicts between committers, approves nominations for a
new committer, removes committer access of inactive committers, and in
general sets the direction of the project as a whole.

Currently, the lead developer is jeffpc.
