Code of Conduct
===============

Introduction
------------

We expect everyone involved with the project to follow this Code of Conduct.
This not only includes developers and contributors but also anyone using
any of the collaborative spaces (such as mailing lists, IRC channels,
submitted patches, commit comments, etc.).

Each individual's behavior is primarily a matter for their personal
conscience. Even so, there are limits whose breach will not be tolerated.
This page explains what is normally expected of community members, and what
is absolutely required.

Interpersonal Interaction
-------------------------

* Keep it civil.
* Be tolerant.
* Remember that you are in public and that your actions determine the public
  perception of the project.
* Do not make it personal. Do not take it personally.

Always strive to present a civil and courteous demeanour in your dealings
with other project members; more so when dealing with third parties from
outside the project. Avoid foul or abusive language: remember that cultural
standards differ, and that what may seem to you to be a very mild statement
can be deeply shocking to another. Avoid contentious topics (unless directly
technically relevant). These things all have their places, but not here,
where they are out of context.

Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Not everyone speaks
or writes English fluently. Not everyone can express themselves clearly.
Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do
not rise to it.

Conflict is inevitable, but unseemly conduct is not. If you must disagree
forcefully, do so within the appropriate technical discussion group and in a
manner that will be acceptable to your audience. Stay focused on the topic
at hand. Heated arguments have a way of dragging in bystanders and mutating
until the original point is lost.

Stick to the facts. Anyone may disagree with you: this does not give you a
license to descend into personal insults. If your arguments cannot stand up
in their own right, then either admit defeat gracefully or formulate better
arguments.

What Will Not Be Tolerated
--------------------------

The following will not be tolerated, and can result in expulsion from the
community:

* Discrimination based on gender, race, nationality, sexuality, religion,
  age or physical disability.
* Bullying or systematic harassment.
* Incitement to or condoning of any of these.

There can be no place within the community for discriminatory speech or
action. We do not believe anyone should be treated any differently based on
who they are, where they are from, where their ancestors were from, what
they look like, what gender they identify as, who they choose to sleep with,
how old they are, their physical capabilities or what sort of religious
beliefs they may hold. What matters is the contribution they are able to
make to the project, and only that.

There is no place within the community for behavior intended to intimidate
or persecute other members of the community. No one should have any cause to
fear involvement with the project.

We will not tolerate any member of the community, either publicly or
privately, giving aid or encouragement to any third party to behave in such
a way towards any members of the community.

The lead will remove any and all access to resources or privileges for
whatever period he deems fit, up to and including a permanent ban where he
rules that a transgression has happened.

In Case of Conflict
-------------------

* If contested, revert your changes first, then argue your case.
* Ask for review.
* Seek approval from maintainers (i.e., area experts).
* When no mutually satisfactory resolution can be achieved, defer to the
  lead

If there is a sustained set of objections to a change you have made, be
graceful and revert what you have done. Objections are hardly likely to be
raised for trivial reasons, and commits can always be re-applied. The
potential loss of reputation for the project from shipping bad code is
permanent.

Seeking review beforehand is the best way to avoid misunderstanding. It is
not just good practice for improving code quality: it facilitates putting
opposing technical arguments clearly and reasonably.

It is strongly encouraged that you consult maintainers before making changes
in their particular areas. It is the duty of committers and maintainers to
keep up-to-date with such standards and practices, and abide by them.
Getting maintainer approval for any change, even if not strictly required,
is never a bad thing, and certainly courteous.

If you cannot agree, you should turn to the lead for arbitration.  A
decision by the lead will be final.
