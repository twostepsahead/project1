Repository Layout
=================

The following directory listing is *not* meant to be exhaustive.  Rather, it
is intended to demonstrate the general organization.  Deviations should be
avoided but are by no means forbidden.

Architecture Subdirectories
---------------------------

In general, the structure of each subdirectory in `arch` mirrors the same
layout as the top level.  That is, there are sub-subdirectories such as
`include` and `kernel`.  In other words, the contents are:

```
arch/x86/bin                    - x86 specific commands
arch/x86/include                - x86 specific headers
arch/x86/kernel                 - x86 specific kernel code
arch/x86/lib                    - x86 specific libs
```

In general, every effort should be made to avoid putting code in
architecture specific directories.  That is, if a feature is in theory
architecture independent, the code code should be put in the architecture
independent directories.  If only some architectures are not fully
supported, proper Sconfig based build-time guards should be used.

Example 1: a PCI device driver that hasn't been ported to sparc should live
in `kernel/drivers` even though it only builds on x86 since PCI devices are
standard between architectures.

Example 2: a CPU microcode updating driver should be placed in `arch/x86`
since microcode update procedures are architecture specific.
